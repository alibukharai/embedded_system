# SPI Integration with Sensor MT6701

The Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) protocol is a widely employed communication method, facilitating efficient and rapid data exchange between microcontrollers and peripheral devices. In this project, we demonstrate the seamless incorporation of the SPI protocol in **Half Duplex mode** into the ESP32 microcontroller, leveraging the capabilities of the Espressif IoT Development Framework (ESP-IDF).

## Output

This project serves the simple purpose of displaying the current angle on the serial monitor.
